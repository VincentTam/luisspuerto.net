  i do have gfxCardStatus in igpu, but still it wont work. idk if that matters,
  but i only have com.apple.kext.AMDLegacySupport and
  com.apple.kext.AMDRadeonX3000 kext loaded, all others dont load and cannot
  load manually either. also tried gpuswitch 0, 1 and 2, no result. maybe need
  clean install and start new
