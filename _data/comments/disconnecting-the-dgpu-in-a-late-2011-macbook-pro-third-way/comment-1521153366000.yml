  Update:

  I did your steps one by one, tested and everything works great! And while
  doing the steps I understand better what it's done.

  I have load some major programs, works perfectly, most important and kinda
  strange: it's faster than before. :)

  Also I did more shut downs, and restarts, so far all good. 

  For now I will stick on Sierra. 

  I am grateful I landed on your blog Luis! 

  Thank you again.
