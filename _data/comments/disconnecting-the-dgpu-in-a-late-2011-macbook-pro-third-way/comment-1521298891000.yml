  so after update if Im stuck at logo, that means I have new working file.  this
  way I will know if system updated the kexts. if it's there and system load i
  have copy that won't work, and system did not made changes.

  in my case I know it will make update of files it's security update with
  restart.

  I noticed when I did overwrite after update I did not lose ownership, it was
  read/write. but will not load in terminal with the script.


  $ sudo cp -r /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions/

  this I enter in terminal, but when u make copy of the kext this means the
  copied file - will not load after. it will be "corrupted" ?


  Ok now understand, if i have new installed kext

  when I move the updated file I rename it:

  $ sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000-1.kext


  AMDRadeonX3000-1.kext will be the new file.  later in terminal I will see
  witch of those two can be loaded.

  as if they are different version maybe old one will not load. now i have
  1.51.8 version of AMDRadeonX3000


  so for example if the new kext AMDRadeonX3000-1.kext load in terminal better
  to keep that without rename and make changes in the nano script to load  that
  file:

  "LoadX3000.sh"

  #!/bin/bash

  kextload /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000-1.kext


  pmset -a gpuswitch 0 # to prevent to switch to the dGPU


  exit 0


  But here Is what makes me scared. what if when you make rename the file is not
  in use anymore, the system, notice when u make rename, copy, or overwrite in
  my last case.


  lol I don't know why I see this so complicated, or I think too much. that's
  why I need simple steps what to do.
