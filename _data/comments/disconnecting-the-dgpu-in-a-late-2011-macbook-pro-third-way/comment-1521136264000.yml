  Hello, I have Macbook pro late 2011. (I had graphic card replace by Apple
  2years ago. And now this problem again.) Started now with fresh Sierra instal
  10.12.6.


  Last night I did this method and got my mac working again, I noticed it's even
  faster than before. But I had some problems, first that I noticed was when
  youtube video was playing after 20min, just when I was on terminal at this
  line: 

  sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25

  sudo pmset -a gp.....


  whole screen froze and you can hear the audio stuck in last word ts ts ts ts,
  so I had to force shutdown. It loaded again. everything was working, but I
  noticed on one time whole screen brightens went to black and lighten up again.
  Still worked after that till I decided to test my build in camera, so when I
  clicked on Photo booth (app) screen froze again as before. 

  (I have read people have this freeze with programs like Photoshop, Ableton
  etc.. and there are some fix for that too. I am still far from installing some
  software to test this.) On the next restart went to gray screen and I could
  hear the fans again. 

  So I know I was back to start again.


  In single user mode I started the "sh /force-iGPU-boot.sh", and in 5sec I was
  on Sierra. I watched movie, and before sleep I did regular shut down. Next
  morning I was on gray screen again.... 

  I did "sh /force-iGPU-boot.sh" again, and now I am here to write this. Can you
  please help me where I do wrong. I think after restart I will see Verbose mode
  again (as I see it regularly now after restart is this ok?)


  p.s. sleep works fine, brightness works too.


  Thank you so much!

  Cheers
