  [&#8230;] As you know, I have had problems with my old MacBook Pro Late 2011
  and its dGPU which I&rsquo;ve been able to&nbsp;patch to make the computer
  work again. In the beginning, the side effect of the fix was not to be able to
  wake up properly the Mac from sleep mode. The computer woke up to a black or
  grey screen and the fans started to work at full speed to finally turn off
  itself. This was cause because on the wake up process the computer decided to
  stuck to the faulty dGPU instead to the iGPU. Luckily, this problem was solve
  as you can see in the final fix. [&#8230;]
