  Thank you again, I saw the forum also, shoutout to MikeyN. 

  But this was cleaner to look at to, as I am not programer or understand what I
  write :), and at the end I did.

  I see some security update for Sierra. I messed up last night. I did the
  update but I did not made copy for the X3000, and I thought I will just move
  it and then I was asked to overwrite and I did, but I ended with not working
  X3000, It was impossible to load the kext, to complete the last step. Today I
  did clean instal. and ...


  I still have the urge to do the update, but I don't understand the last step:



  $ sudo cp -r /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions/

  -this will make copy in the original folder right ?

  sh /force-iGPU-boot.sh

  -this I know.

  $ sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions-off/

  -ok this is for the move of the newly created file.

  $ sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000-1.kext

  -but here don't know what to expect. 

  when I enter step 3, I will be asked to rename the old one? What should I do
  when asked or ..?

  or should I manually rename it?

  the renamed file will stay in the same folder?  what to do with it?



  did you made this step? any tips?

  for your problem why you don't turn the sleep to never in energy saver?


  Cheers
