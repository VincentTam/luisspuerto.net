message: "You're really welcomed! \nAbout updating to High Sierra and so. Ponder if you really want to do that, because in the beginning –when I wanted to fix this problem–\_I found more people that was able fix it easier in Sierra than in High Sierra. So be careful, if you happy with Sierra, perhaps you don't need to upgrade."
