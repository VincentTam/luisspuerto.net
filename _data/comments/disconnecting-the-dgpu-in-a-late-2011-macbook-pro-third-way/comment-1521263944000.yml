  Hi!


  Yes, you have to rename the kext, or at least it's recomendable.
  <code>mv</code>in terminal works for moving files and for rename. 

  The idea is that you don't know if Apple is going to update the kexts or not,
  so you bring things back to <code>normal</code> update and take again the
  problematic kext out of the folder. In the spirit to keep every single kext
  you move, you rename the new one. Perhaps it's a better idea to rename the old
  one and copy the new one. I'll try to explain this better.


  Be careful when you move those files... they lose the ownership pretty quick
  if you don't move then on terminal and being logged as root <code>sudo</code>.
  If they don't load check the permissions / ownership.
