  funny thing, i just noticed that my system doesnt even contain the
  AMDRadeonX3000.kext, only the AMDRadeonX3000.bundle??! how come? im on fresh
  installed high sierra 10.13.2. my mbp stopped working and i tried to do the
  fix, but there was no kext to move and so i stucked on system not booting. i
  started from extern hd and found out that there is no AMDRadeonX3000.kext at
  all. now my system works perfect again but without x3000. i would like to
  install the last update but im affraid to fuck up the system again. any
  suggestions?
