  I really don't know what could be really wrong. In the end you have to think
  that this is just a rig to be able to continue to use your computer although
  it's broken. I haven't experience anything like you have experience, but I'm
  in High Sierra and I haven't been watching any movie lately, but I've been
  doing some other intensive iGPU jobs.


  Two/three things that can come to my mind are:


  <ul>

  <li>Check if the <code>AMDRadeonX3000.kext</code> is really out of the
  <code>/System/Library/Extensions/</code></li>

  <li>Check the ownership of all the kexts, whether or not they are in the
  <code>/System/Library/Extensions/</code> or in
  <code>/System/Library/Extensions-off/</code></li>

  <li>Check if all the kext related to graphics load. </li>

  <li>See if something in your system is forcing to try to use the dGPU. I
  haven't use sierra –I didn't like it– I jumped from El Capitan to High Sierra.
  Perhaps your movie app or something. </li>

  </ul>


  If you still have problems, I recommend you to post in the thread about issue
  in the MacRumors forums. I think the link is in my post.
