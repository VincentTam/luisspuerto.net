  ok, there is no AMD6000Controller.kext at all, nowhere. must have deleted it
  somehow? all others are there. AMDLegacyFramebuffer.kext is read and write.


  "/Users/me/AMDLegacyFramebuffer.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) not
  found; check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8)." - this is
  what i get if i try to "sudo kextload AMDLegacyFramebuffer.kext


  can i just download AMD6000Controller.kext? or need to reinstall?
