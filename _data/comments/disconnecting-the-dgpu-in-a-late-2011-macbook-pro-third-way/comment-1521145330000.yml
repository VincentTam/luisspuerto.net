  Thank you for the fast reply,

  just checked the folders and: kexts are still in /System/Library/Extensions/
  including AMDRadeonX3000.kext,

  they are not in the new created folder: (your name
  "/System/Library/Extensions-off/") (my name "AMD_Kexts") this folder is
  empty. 

  All 4 kext are load:
    102    2 0xffffff7f83b6b000 0x122000   0x122000   com.apple.kext.AMDLegacySupport (1.5.1) 0670744B-B64C-3424-B186-FD972A37E78E 
    130    0 0xffffff7f83cd0000 0x12e000   0x12e000   com.apple.kext.AMD6000Controller (1.5.1) 2015FD1C-294C-3C71-AEB5-C1EE0E65BD46 
    141    0 0xffffff7f83520000 0x571000   0x571000   com.apple.AMDRadeonX3000 (1.5.1) F6F37414-893B-3F66-8AB7-F3327DE6AC55 
    148    0 0xffffff7f83c9a000 0x22000    0x22000    com.apple.kext.AMDLegacyFramebuffer (1.5.1) 930A7077-5EBD-3FA5-A023-415A1438E132 

  For now I was able to boot just with: sh /force-iGPU-boot.sh, 

  and I see now the line in this script is different of my folder "AMD_Kexts" : 
  kextload /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000.kext 

  in my case should be: kextload /AMD_Kexts/AMDRadeonX3000.kext ?


  I will start over and use your folder name now, and see what happens.

  Thank you again, just by writing to you, I notice this mistake. I will try
  this and write back.


  p.s. Maybe is better for me to update with High Sierra and start over. I think
  it will work better maybe. Just don't know should I start right after the
  update is done, or should I stop it and enter the code.
