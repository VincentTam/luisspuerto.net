  I'm glad that worked for you! When you understand the solution it's kinda
  silly and really simple. You have to think that it load everything faster
  because it doesn't have to be shifting between the two cards it just sticks
  with one. If you don't do anything that it's really GPU intense it's going to
  be really fine. You have to think you have a kind of MacBook Air.


  As I think I've mentioned in the post, I still have some problems from time to
  time with the wake up from sleep. Perhaps you aren't going to have any of
  those since Sierra seems to be more stable in that department. Basically what
  happens is the screen doesn't turn on after I pull up the lid and I have to
  reboot. It's a random error that I really don't know why happens. Before the
  dGPU crashed it happened also, but perhaps once every 6 months or so.


  I didn't developed this solution, I just put it here to make it more clear,
  but the ones that came out with it are the people from MacRumors forum.
