  You can rename the other way around... I mean. First rename the file you
  already have in <code>Extensions-off</code> and then you copy the new file.
  You do that this way for example.


  <pre><code class="sh">$ sudo mv
  /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000-1.kext

  $ sudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMDRadeonX3000.kext
  /System/Library/Extensions-off/AMDRadeonX3000.kext

  </code></pre>


  This way you always know that the last one is the one with the correct name
  and not the ones renamed.


  Regarding why I don't set <code>hibernatemode 25</code>... I have that way for
  a while, but it also happen to me from time to time that the computer doesn't
  wake up correctly. Funny thing was it loaded, I could see the bar loading the
  hibernation info from hard drive, but at the end the screen ended up black. So
  I decided to leave it in <code>hibernatemode 3</code>.
