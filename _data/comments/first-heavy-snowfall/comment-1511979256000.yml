  Looks lovely but that ice is deadly. It looks so much like Minnesota winters
  we remember. Florida is very nice. ‘Would recommend a visit here sometime in
  the winter. You would love the beaches. We are in Fort Myers on the Gukf
  Coast. Someone told me that a lot of Finnish people own land around the Lake
  Worth area here and spend their winters here.


  Disappointed you won’t be here this year but hoping that the Forestry
  department comes up with a position for Ollala sometime on the future. Would
  love to have you in the area again.  Will send your email to Carl again. It
  sounds like they have been busy with updates and repairs on the carousel. It
  is hard to adapt a 100 year old carousel to modern controls. One of the horses
  got cracked so it is being repaired. Overall they are working out the kinks
  and is very popular with the community.


  I am looking forward to going home and having this knee worked on. I feel like
  I’ve aged st least 10 years this year because I can’t move around very well.
  Barclay is dreading the drive back home. We switch off driving but 3400 miles
  is a long drive.


  Take care. Keep in touch. Hugs to you both.
