  Great guide, but is there an advantage to using Openblas over Apple's
  Accelerate library? The benchmarks I've seen before suggest that they perform
  about the same. But since the default for Homebrew R is to use Accelerate,
  this seems like the simpler solution. Would love to hear your thoughts.


  And since I'm here... I had to switch to the binary R installer because
  Homebrew R wouldn't work with the R-INLA package. (I get the same error as
  this guy:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45494818/r-library-breaks-due-to-failure-in-loading-dyld).
  This is obviously beyond the scope of your post, but I was wondering if you
  had any idea on what might be going on there? I'd love to switch back to a
  100% Homebrew solution.


  Thanks again for the post, and any other thoughts you might have.
