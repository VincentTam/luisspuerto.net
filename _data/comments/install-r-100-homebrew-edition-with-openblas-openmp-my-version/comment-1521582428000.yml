  Thanks for the reply. Looks like they (recently?) changed the default matrix
  algebra library for binary R! It used to default to R's (slow) reference
  matrix algebra library, which is of course quite slow.


  Regarding INLA, I was able to install it without problems as well, but it
  throws those errors when you try to run a model. The INLA folks have suggested
  it's a problem with Homebrew R, but I can't imagine why that would be.


  In any case, thanks for taking the time to look into it!
