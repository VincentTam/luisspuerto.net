  About the benchmarking of R homebrew vs R homebrew with openblas (and openmp),
  well I haven't seen any specific for both cases. However... I can tell you
  that R binary from CRAN has <a
  href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Which-BLAS-is-used-and-how-can-it-be-changed_003f"
  rel="nofollow">that implementation</a> and performed much worse in my wife's
  computer than with openBlas from Homebrew (those are the results at the
  beginning of the post) I can't tell about just the Homebrew version. I had it
  for a while and then switched to the openBlas version, but in the change I
  didn't perform a benchmark.


  About the other question. I installed that package and seems that everything
  is OK. I've compiled it without problem and loaded also without a warning.
  Usually those problems are fixed with you install everything again...


  I installed INLA with:


  <pre><code class="r">install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"),
  INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)

  </code></pre>


  Because if I try CRAN I get:


  <pre><code class="r">&gt; install.packages("INLA")

  Installing package into ‘/Users/lpuerto/Library/R/3.x/library’

  (as ‘lib’ is unspecified)

  Warning in install.packages :
    package ‘INLA’ is not available (for R version 3.4.4)
  </code></pre>
