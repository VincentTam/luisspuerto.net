Some months ago my wife brought to my attention [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is a _blog aware static-site __generator_, or in other words it&#8217;s a piece of software that allows you to beautiful generate static websites. At that moment, I didn&#8217;t play too much attention to it, and just look for some comparisons between it and WordPress and I came to the conclusion that it wasn&#8217;t worth even a try.

<div id="attachment_1548" style="width: 315px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <a href="http://luisspuerto.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/octojekyll.png"><img class="wp-image-1548" src="http://luisspuerto.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/octojekyll.png" alt="" width="305" height="255" srcset="http://luisspuerto.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/octojekyll.png 660w, http://luisspuerto.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/octojekyll-300x251.png 300w, http://luisspuerto.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/octojekyll-299x250.png 299w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></a>

However, after some months and seeing [some examples](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites) of what you can do with it I think I&#8217;m going to give it another shot. Most of the webs you can see there are quite simple, just a couple of static pages and perhaps a simple blog. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t build complex and beautiful websites with it –as [some of the examples](http://jentrata.org) can proof– after all it&#8217;s just HTML. I&#8217;m not an HTML expert, quite the opposite. I have little experience programing on it and it was mostly long time ago when I begun to browse internet. However, since little by little I learning how to program in R and some shell commands, I think I&#8217;m going to give a try.

Jekyll has been developed by the GitHub team and for that reason they play quite good together. Some of the advantages of it are the following:

  * It&#8217;s free and open source.
  * It&#8217;s cheap. You can host your web almost anywhere for free. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offer you free tiers where almost anyone page can be hosted. So you don&#8217;t have to deal with expensive hosting.
  * It&#8217;s fast. Everything is really lightweight so you don&#8217;t need to a lot of things to optimize how fast it loads
  * It&#8217;s simple. You don&#8217;t have to deal with databases.
  * It&#8217;s blog aware. Just following some simple formatting rules Jekyll can create for you a blog.
  * You can use Git to post. Since everything is a file and nothing is store in a database you can just use git to track your changes and post content.
  * Uses markdown, so pretty simple to post content.
  * You can use themes
  * You can use plugins.

Probably, people that have been using it for longer can give you a more compressive list of its advantages. In my case, I just going give a try and try to generate something similar to my current web with it. My playground is going to be [jekyll.luisspuerto.net](http://jekyl.luisspuerto.net), which is hosted in GitHub Pages.

There are a lot of documentation about it in its [official page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and I just found a couple of youtube videos [[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkDc6KPvLhw) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc)] that look quite interesting. There is also an [extensive community](https://talk.jekyllrb.com) that can always give you a hand if you run into trouble or get stuck. Just to share with you some of the resources I just found in a minute of searching.

Let&#8217;s see what I can achieve.
