This is my very blog post&#8230; this post should&#8217;ve been a way earlier than it is being, but life is as it is.

I was thinking also into change the &#8220;featured image&#8221; WordPress is offering but I thought that is fine, since we are in America and this is my first post of my American writing period. The photo is New York City if you haven&#8217;t notice, so a really good for an opening post from USA.

This blog has several purposes. I think that the first one is to practice my writing in English and make me more fluent in the Shakespeare language. Yes, I need to improve.

Second one, is try to express myself and to put in black and white my experiences, personal and professional ones. I&#8217;m trying to write about myself, my opinions, what I like and what I don&#8217;t like (or hate), my hobbies and last but not least my profession. Summing it up, what it seemed as a good idea in the moment I wrote about it, so don&#8217;t take it too seriously, perhaps my ideas have already evolve in the moment you&#8217;re reading about them.

So, what kind of topics can you expect here? Forestry, GIS, remote sensing, LiDAR, science & research, politics, nature, hiking, photography, technology and probably many many other topics that they will come across my mind the future and they don&#8217;t come to my mind right now. I usually like to talk and draw comparisons about the countries where I&#8217;ve been or lived. So be prepare to read about Spain, Sweden, Finland and Europe in general, and of course USA, specially Oregon where I live now, and NYC, my favorite city in the world.

My style of writing around here is going to be really informal, but I&#8217;ll try to keep my grammar and style in shape. I&#8217;m here to look for a honest conversation. First with myself and then with you. Yes, you, because if it were a conversation just with myself this would be a monologue and pretty boring, so please comment.

Since English isn&#8217;t my native language, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to make a lot of mistakes, typos, grammatical horrors and probably my style is going to leave a lot to be desired. However, you&#8217;re there to take care of that, you that hero of the grammar and style. I really encourage you to tell me if you see anything wrong in my writing, Please, I&#8217;m here to learn.

Returning to the topic of, why I didn&#8217;t write earlier? Well, for a lot of reasons. First, I didn&#8217;t feel the need, and second, this blog wasn&#8217;t ready. Now, today, in this instant, I&#8217;m feeling the need to start blogging again and this is good.

Currently, I&#8217;m with my wife Olalla, in Corvallis (OR) and we are going to be here at least until September, learning. Learning about forest, English, american life and getting new experiences. Isn&#8217;t life made of experiences?

SEE YOU AROUND!

PS1/ You&#8217;ll se more New York in September, when we&#8217;ll reach there.

PS2/ Edit: I&#8217;ve edited this on 15 May, to fix some typos and grammar mistakes.
