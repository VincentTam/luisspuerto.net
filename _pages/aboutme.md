My name is Luis Puerto and I'm from <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponferrada" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ponferrada</a></strong>, a medium size town in the <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ponferrada,+Le%C3%B3n,+Spain/@41.9308893,-7.7021,7.93z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd30ba8c4ef7b633:0xdc636ce1ab239060!8m2!3d42.5499958!4d-6.598259?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Northwest of Spain</a> &#x1f1ea;&#x1f1f8;</strong> and the main city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Bierzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El Bierzo</a> county. El Bierzo, <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/07/inenglish/1475851411_631393.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a small region</a> formed basically for a valley ending in Galicia and surrounded by Asturias and León.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  There, I spent the first 30 years of my life and I went to  <a href="http://www.iesgilycarrasco.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high school</a> and college at <a href="https://www.unileon.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of León</a>, where I got a <strong>Degree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forestry</a> and Environmental Engineering.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  In the last years of my studies and after I got my degree, I worked in different forestry related projects around my region, where I got experience in <strong>GIS, GPS, forest management and inventory.</strong> Later, I landed in a non-profict organization related to the Spanish government, whose aims were related to the development El Bierzo, CO2 capture technologies and the Energy Museum. I was there for almost 4 years working in different positions, doing incredible different tasks and getting a great experience. I learned how <strong>a big organization works, how to manage big projects and budgets, I polished my cartographic skills and I got experience managing teams.</strong> I started as a responsible of field work for a research project related to <strong>chestnut tree blight</strong> and ended as responsible of the <strong>technology and innovation</strong> area.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  After that, I decided look for an international career and moved to Umeå, Sweden &#x1f1f8;&#x1f1ea;. I was living there for 6 months enjoying the Swedish life and people, being a little <em>Skogstokig</em>, learning a little bit of Swedish (<em>jaaahhaa!!</em>) and about fire management in the North or Europe. Finally, I enrolled in the <a href="http://www.igeon.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iGEON master</a> about <strong>GIS and remote sensing</strong>, from Lund University. Then, my SO decided to move to Joensuu, Finland &#x1f1eb;&#x1f1ee; for professional reasons where we've been living for more than 3 years (yes, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/luisspuerto/16673834879/in/album-72157649101416244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it's cold!</a>, but only with the wrong clothing). There, I had the opportunity to learn Finnish (<em>minä puhun vähän suomea</em>), enjoy Finnish forest and sauna, learn a little bit of cross-country skiing and discover Finnish people and their silence.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Currently, I'm living in <strong>Corvallis, Oregon, USA &#x1f1fa;&#x1f1f8;</strong>. My main objective here is to discover the Pacific Northwest and the American culture, and polish my English and meet people, of course.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  My main areas of interest are, as you could guess for my background, <strong>forestry</strong> and <strong>engineering</strong> although I'm also interested in <strong>science</strong> and <strong>technology</strong> in general. I'm a really curious person and I'm usually interested in everything. While I was in Finland, I have the opportunity to learn and explore about <strong>remote sensing, LiDAR, biomass and research</strong>, and my current ongoing projects are related to those areas, while I finish my master. Recently, I also discover my interesest about <strong>statistics</strong> (I always hate them) and more specific about the <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.r-project.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rStats</a>,<strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data science</a> </strong>and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> data </strong><b>visualization</b></a> fields (long life to <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tufte</a>). Perhaps, for the influence of the people I have around (thanks!) and my fair-good relation with computers. Also, perhaps, because for me is a way to squeeze data and see the &#8220;hidden truth&#8221;. Finally, I interested in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big data analysis</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocomputer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nanocomputing</a></strong> and new ways to get data.

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Above all of that and in more personal setting, I really like the <strong>outdoors</strong> and I'm always ready to <strong>explore</strong> and <strong>camp in the wilderness</strong>. I'm interested in wide spectrum of <strong>music</strong>, <strong>photography</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur19338098/ratings?sort=ratings_date%3Adesc&view=detail&start=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movies</a></strong> too. For a while, I was doing a little bit of <strong>horseback riding</strong> and <strong>archery</strong>. During my stay in Finland, I developed an acute interest in <strong>baking bread and pizza</strong>, mainly because for us was difficult to find Spanish style (hard crust) bread there and I learned using <a href="http://kensartisan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ken's book</a> (I was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BS6vNqLgML3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently in his bakery</a> and I have to say it was a delicious experience).
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Other fields that call my attention are, politics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">globalization and internationalization</a> (in the human sense) and work management and organization (mainly through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifth Discipline</a>). <strong>Astronomy</strong> and <strong>space exploration</strong> are of my interest too. And of course, <strong>history</strong>, as a way to learn from others experience.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  On a final note, I've been also trying to improve my concentration through meditation, but the nirvana is something difficult to reach (<em>damn!</em>). I dream with <strong>learning to fly</strong> and to <strong>sail</strong> someday.
