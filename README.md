# Readme of jekyll.luisspuerto.net

This is the readme of my Jekyll page. What I'm trying to do is to port my all Wordpress page to Jekyll, keeping on the way most of the things and trying to improve the ones I wasn't happy with.

This is mainly a work in progress right now so expect some things being odd or not in place. You can check what I want to do in my [TODO](TODO.md) file. 

I would be really happy if my work can help others also to change their website.
