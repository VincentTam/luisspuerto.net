# Readme of jekyll.luisspuerto.net

This is the readme of my Jekyll page. What I'm trying to do is to port my all Wordpress page to Jekyll, keeping on the way most of the things and trying to improve the ones I wasn't happy with. 

I would be really happy if my work can help others also to change their website.
